# ReactJS Boilerplate

Boilerplate repo for starting ReactJS apps. Mostly for personal use and sandboxing,
though also potentially a nice resource for beginners to get to know React
and a lot of the supporting libraries (webpack, babel, redux, etc.)

For beginners, I highly recommend starting from the [first React-related commit]
(https://github.com/cooperka/react-simple-boilerplate/commit/a6798d0fb328eff471b9ba4e4104061ff237885a)
and working your way along from there.
I tried to organize all the work into single, standalone commits that are easy to read and follow.

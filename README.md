# React Perf

Basic performance testing for React, forked from
a much earlier version of [master](https://github.com/cooperka/react-simple-boilerplate).

## Usage

1. Clone the repo
2. `npm i`
3. `npm start`
4. Navigate to <http://localhost:8080>

## Results

So far, elements and components seem about the same in terms of render time.
